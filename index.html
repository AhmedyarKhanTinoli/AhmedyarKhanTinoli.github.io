    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>    
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <liMelt a few tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile melt the remaining butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat along with the tomato sauce, heavy cream, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low; cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss cubed chicken breast with vegetable oil until coated, then season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. Once done, add the chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
